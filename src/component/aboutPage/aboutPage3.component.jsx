            The heart of Hogwarts lies in its unique house systemâ€”Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.
            Each house has its own distinctive qualities, fostering a sense of camaraderie and competition among students.
            The Sorting Hat, during the Sorting Ceremony, assigns students to houses based on their personalities and values,
            creating lasting bonds that transcend magical education. The common rooms become second homes,
            and shared dormitories forge friendships that last a lifetime.
